## Overview
Jupyter Notebook performing data analysis and modeling on data taken from speed dating sessions.

## Goals
- Determine the qualities that best predict a "yes" decision on a speed dating partner
- Build models that predict yes/no decisions, and test their accuracies
- Describe differences between men and women in the qualities that predict their decisions
- Calculate how accurately participants predict whether their partners like them

## Current Phase
Trained models and scored them on the training and testing sets. Next, calculate how accurately
people predicted their partner's decision.

## Requirements and Usage
- Jupyter notebook/Jupyter lab
- Tested on Python 3.10.0

## Data Source
Data is from Kaggle: [Speed Dating | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/speed-dating)
